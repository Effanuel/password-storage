## Password Storage using MERN

This is a minimal password storage application.

### Current Features

- Keep your passwords safe with a help of an encrypting algorithm;
- Built with **TypeScript** *(yes, its a feature these days)*;
- Clicking on one of the cards will copy the password to the clipboard; *(doesn't work with Firefox)*

### Built With

The Backend was built using **Node + Express** and the Frontend, **React + Redux**. Styled components were taken from **React Bootstrap**. Mongo database is managed with a help of **Mongoose**

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)

*Note: since this repo has been last worked on a while ago, its a good example of how not to write redux code.*
